            As a Technical Architect, I am brought on most new projects from
            before the first call with the client. I’m responsible for
            estimating most project times and identifying risks. When the
            project is ready to start, I may lead development or onboard a new
            lead. It’s also partly my role to identify what our developers are
            interested in, match them with projects that can fit their interest,
            and assisting them in the growing process.
          </p> -->

          <p style="padding-top: 0.5em">
            I’ve acted as the project lead or a major contributor to dozens of
            projects across several industries. A small sample includes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Adjusting how our company hosts projects so we can spend more time
              working on our clients’ goals and less time dealing with site
              outages and writing integration scripts
            </li>
            <li>
              Re-invented how our team creates projects, reduced startup time
              for most projects by weeks, reduced knowledge silos between
              projects, removed need for most large servers, and increased web
              performance scores
            </li>
            <li>
              Lead development for an IoT application for the largest water
              heater manufacturer in North America. The application allows both
              technicians and commercial water heater owners to control the
              temperature of their industrial-sized unit and receive important
              notifications about the water heater (e.g. gas leak or electrical
              shortage)
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed multiple real-time dashboard solutions for a Fortune 500
              healthcare agency. Users of the applications range from admitting
              clerks in emergency rooms to the company’s top managers. One such
              application is responsible for ensuring new emergency room
              visitors will be triaged in under 10 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
              Greatly reduced number of high-risk projects and unexpected
              outages for the agency by moving all projects to repositories,
              exploring and establishing CI/CD practices, creating the first
              technical steering committee, and setting up initial testing
              standards
